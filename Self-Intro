### Self intro

Hi, I’m Sathish Ravulapenta, a DevOps Engineer with over 3 years of experience in automating infrastructure, managing CI/CD pipelines, and optimizing cloud resources across Azure and AWS environments.
I specialize in building scalable, secure deployment pipelines using tools like Azure DevOps, Jenkins, GitHub, and Terraform. I’ve integrated static code analysis tools such as TruffleHog, SonarQube, and Black Duck to enhance code quality and compliance.
My recent work at TCS involved implementing infrastructure as code using Terraform Enterprise, automating secret management with HashiCorp Vault, and improving observability with Azure Application Insights. I’ve also handled on-call support, created runbooks, and optimized Azure Boards for streamlined team productivity.
I'm passionate about reliability, automation, and enabling faster, safer software delivery through DevOps best practices.
